If you want to activate Windows Server 2012 R2 on your corporate network without connecting to the Internet, you can use KMSpico, a tool that can emulate a Key Management Service (KMS) server and activate any version of Windows or Microsoft Office within seconds.
 
KMSpico is a free, clean and legal tool that can replace the installed product key with a volume license key, create an emulated instance of a KMS server on your machine and force the products to activate against this KMS server. KMS activation only lasts for 180 days after which, it must be activated again. However, by using KMSpico, an activation service is created which runs KMSpico twice a day to reset this counter.

## Step 1: Download and Install KMSpico
 
The first step is to download KMSpico from its official website: [https://www.getkmspico.com/](https://www.getkmspico.com/). You can also find the latest version of KMSpico on various online forums and torrent sites, but be careful of fake or malicious downloads.
 
After downloading the zip file, extract it and run the installer. Follow the instructions on the screen and accept the terms and conditions. The installation process is very simple and fast. You don't need to change any settings or options.
 
## Step 2: Activate Windows Server 2012 R2 with KMSpico
 
After installing KMSpico, you will see a shortcut on your desktop. Double-click it to launch the program. You will see a window with a red button and some information about your system.
 
Before you press the red button, make sure that your Windows Server 2012 R2 has a Generic Volume License Key (GVLK) installed. This is a special product key that tells Windows to look for a KMS server on the network. You can find the GVLK for Windows Server 2012 R2 on this page: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/jj612867(v=ws.11)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/jj612867%28v=ws.11%29).
 
If you don't have a GVLK installed, you can use the command prompt to install it. Open an elevated command prompt (right-click and select Run as administrator) and type the following command:

    slmgr /ipk 

Replace <gvlk> with the actual product key for your edition of Windows Server 2012 R2. For example, if you have Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard edition, use this command:</gvlk>

    slmgr /ipk D2N9P-3P6X9-2R39C-7RTCD-MDVJX

After installing the GVLK, you can press the red button on KMSpico. You will hear a voice saying "Program complete". This means that KMSpico has successfully activated your Windows Server 2012 R2 with a KMS server emulated on your machine.
 
## Step 3: Check the Activation Status
 
To verify that your Windows Server 2012 R2 is activated, you can use the command prompt or the graphical interface.
 
To use the command prompt, open an elevated command prompt and type the following command:

    slmgr /xpr

You will see a pop-up window showing that your Windows is permanently activated.
 
To use the graphical interface, open Control Panel and go to System and Security > System. You will see that your Windows is activated under Windows activation section.
